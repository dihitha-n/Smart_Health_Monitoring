# Smart_Health_Monitoring

## Project Overview
An IoT-based health monitoring system allows patients to continuously track their health parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, using internet-enabled devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers. These devices collect real-time data and transmit it to platforms like ThingSpeak for analysis.

The data collected is sent to healthcare providers, enabling remote monitoring and timely intervention when necessary. If any readings exceed predefined thresholds, alerts are sent to both the patient and healthcare provider, ensuring quick action in case of health emergencies.

ThingSpeak also integrates with wearable devices to track physical activity, providing insights into overall health. Its visualization tools allow healthcare professionals to monitor trends, making it easier to provide personalized treatment and recommendations for improving health outcomes.
